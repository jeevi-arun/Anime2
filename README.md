Created a mini project to explore the power of CSS animations and transitions in creating smooth, user-friendly visual effects. This practice helped me understand:

âœ¨ Basic to intermediate keyframe animations
âœ¨ Transition effects on hover and interaction
âœ¨ Timing functions for natural movement
âœ¨ Keeping animations subtle and performance-friendly

Through this project, I learned how even simple animations can enhance user experience when used thoughtfully.

Tools Used:
ðŸ”§ HTML, CSS (Keyframes, Transitions)
